# Timelapse

This repo contains a timelapse making script & console app.

These were used to create a timelapse of my drive being re-done (blog post to follow)

## The Setup

Webcam hooked up to a Linux machine, using a bash script to take an image every minute.

C# console app takes the raw images & adds a timestamp to the bottom corner based on the file date.

Once all the images have been updated, these are compiled into a AVI or MP4 file at 30 FPS.

With this setup, an hour real-time is 2 seconds of output footage. - A day is therefore 48 seconds.

## The Final Results

Stay tuned, blog post to be written with links to the final video result :-)
